# Ahoy-hoy!

I'm an economist interested in statistical modeling.

What I'm currently up to:

* **Learning:** Julia. Say no to R and Matlab!
* **Studying:** Convex optimization. I'm following [this Stanford MOOC on edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/engineering/stanford-university-convex-optimization) as a guide.
* **Reading:** _Canadians in the Making: A Social History of Canada_, Arthur Lower (1960).
